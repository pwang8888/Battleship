# Battleship Game

## Overview

This project implements a **simplified Battleship Game** in Java. It is a console-based, one-player game where the player attempts to sink the computer's fleet of ships placed on a 10x10 grid.

The game demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
